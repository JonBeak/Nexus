## Current Migration System
Active migrations are tracked in the parent directory:
- `/migrations/` - Ongoing migration system for incremental changes
- Migration files in `/migrations/` represent the current approach to database changes

## Notes
- These scripts are preserved for historical reference and rollback analysis
- All changes from these scripts are now part of the production database structure  
- If rollback is ever needed, these files contain the exact changes that were applied
- Do not re-run these scripts - they have already been applied

## Safety Notes
- `remove_redundant_columns.sql` created backup table before making changes
- Both scripts included verification queries to confirm successful application
- Changes were made with proper error handling and transaction safety
