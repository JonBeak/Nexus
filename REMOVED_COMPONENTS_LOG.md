# Removed Components Log - Grid Base Architecture Refactor

## Date: 2025-09-12

## Components Being Replaced

### Current Broken System Components:
1. **Complex State Management**: useSimpleGridState, useGridValidation, batchStateManager
2. **Multiple Managers**: AssemblyManager, RowManager, ValidationManager 
3. **Fragmented Utilities**: parentAssignmentUtils, groupUtils, cellStylingEngine
4. **Heavy GridJobBuilderRefactored**: 379 lines with complex hooks and effects

### Issues with Current System:
- State management spread across multiple hooks causing race conditions
- Complex drag/drop logic mixed with business logic
- Assembly management tightly coupled to validation
- No clear data flow - mutations happening in multiple places
- Performance issues due to constant re-calculations
- Difficult to debug and maintain

## Replacement Strategy:

### New Base Layer Architecture:
1. **GridEngine**: Single source of truth orchestrator
2. **Layered Calculations**: Pure functions for each concern
3. **Immutable Transformations**: Clear data flow
4. **Modular Design**: Testable, maintainable components

### Files Being Replaced:
- `GridJobBuilderRefactored.tsx` → New implementation using GridEngine
- Complex hook system → Simple GridEngine integration
- Multiple manager classes → Pure calculation functions
- Fragmented utilities → Organized layer system

### Backward Compatibility:
- Same props interface for GridJobBuilderRefactored
- Same EstimateRow data structure for parent components
- Internal adapter functions for data conversion

## Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for each layer function
- Integration tests for GridEngine
- Validation against existing data
- Performance benchmarking
