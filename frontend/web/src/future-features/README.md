# Future Features

This directory contains completed or near-completed features that are not currently active in the application but are ready for future implementation.

## CategoryManager.tsx

**Status**: 80% Complete - Ready for Backend Integration  
**Business Value**: High - Essential for material categorization in manufacturing  
**Lines of Code**: 578 lines  
**Last Updated**: December 2024

### Purpose
Dynamic material category management system for supply chain operations. Allows creation and management of material categories (Vinyl, LED, Power Supply, etc.) with flexible field definitions.

### Current Features âœ…
- Dynamic field schema builder (6 field types: text, number, decimal, select, boolean, date)
- Field reordering and validation
- Category CRUD operations with visual icons
- Professional UI with modal-based editing
- Complete TypeScript API integration layer
- Responsive design with proper error handling

### What's Missing
1. **Backend API Routes** (~2 days) - Database tables and endpoints
2. **Dashboard Integration** (~1 day) - Add "Categories" tab to SupplyChainDashboard
3. **Product Linking** (~3 days) - Connect categories to product creation forms

### Implementation Notes
- Import path when ready: `import { CategoryManager } from '../future-features/CategoryManager';`
- API service already exists: `/services/categoriesApi.ts`
- No breaking changes needed - self-contained component

### Estimated Implementation Time: 1 week
### ROI: High - Enables scalable product management without code changes for new material types
